assistant: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF ENHANCEMENT OPTIONS

Today's financial analytics landscape is rapidly being reshaped by advances in artificial intelligence, specifically through the use of chatbots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Here's an overview of current capabilities and prospects:

1) **Foundation Model Access and Specialization**: Current LLM-powered chatbots have unprecedented access to a wide array of information and demonstrate reasonable comprehension of financial terminology and concepts. Over the next 6 months, personalizing these generic models for specialized financial domains is anticipated to still involve a manual, somewhat tedious process. However, as platforms evolve and quality control becomes more automated, the adaptation process will likely speed up. With the democratization of model development and the availability of curated dataset collections, we can foresee an exponential increase in domain-specific experts emerging within two years. In approximately five years, the groundwork laid today will lead to a variety of dedicated financial analysis LLMs built upon a smaller number of versatile general models, possibly with interchangeable skills or memory capsules.

2) **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**: While fine-tuning tailors a single model, deploying MAS enables collaboration among multiple bots to achieve complex financial analytic goals. Despite the potential, MAS currently relies heavily on manually designed protocols and human oversight, as autonomous learning for these systems is complex and not yet widespread. Nevertheless, the maturation of tool connection platforms in the next six months could aid in creating basic multi-step web API flows, enabling the delegation of tasks such as information retrieval, analytics, and document management to specialized bots. The subsequent few years could witness the rise of end-user-friendly MAS, driven by improvements in automated protocol learning and graphical workflow builders. A five-year forecast suggests significant advancements in MAS, with the potential for simplified high-level goal setting and robust intranet matching capabilities for financial domains.

3) **Virtual and Robotic Extensions**: The current interface of choice is conversational; however, achieving more intricate goals in finance—such as those requiring precise motor skills or the integration of multimedia sensory information—is still beyond reach for purely textual bots. In the next six months, we may see the beginnings of bridging LLMs with existing robotic and virtual reality (VR) technology, though real-world application robustness is unlikely in the short term. In two years, the integration of conversational interfaces with simulators and reusable skill libraries could usher in novel custom use cases in financial analytics. Extending this to a five-year horizon, we may see sophisticated, differentiable simulators combined with cloud robotics, enabling comprehensive LLM policy learning specific to the financial industry without the need for task-specialized programming.

The above enhancements stem from a broad spectrum of LLMs, including smaller-scale open-source models like Anthropic's Constitutional Claude and EleutherAI's GPT-NeoX 20B. These smaller models exhibit the potential for exceptional performance in niche financial domains when they're fine-tuned appropriately. The ongoing challenge lies in the scarcity of machine learning (ML) expertise required for such specialization and in assembling datasets that maintain the model's generalizability.

Should you have any inquiries or require more details on any of the aforementioned options, please do not hesitate to seek further clarification.

assistant: Hello! How can I assist you today with regards to artificial intelligence and its impact on financial analysis? If you're interested in understanding the outlook for AI systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) in your field, I can provide you with some forecasts. Let's begin with the outlook for LLMs in financial analysis as per the information provided:

### OUTLOOK

**Six Months Outlook**
With Google’s ‘Gemini Ultra’ model release, we'll see LLMs leap in capabilities, enhancing the foundational LLM/chatbot layer with sophisticated multimodal input handling: Gemini Ultra's achieved a higher score than GPT-4 in the MMMU benchmark, which assesses a range of capabilities. The main novelty of Gemini Ultra is to natively handle multiple types of data, including images, audio, and live video. This will improve data extraction from reports with better capabilities to read charts and tables, aiding in more comprehensive analysis while still requiring human oversight. It will also enable summarizing live events and TV reports.
Google has also recently unveiled AlphaCode 2, powered by the Gemini AI model. AlphaCode 2 demonstrates notable advancements in coding capabilities and is particularly adept at handling complex mathematical and theoretical computer science challenges. It employs dynamic programming, a method of breaking down complex problems into simpler sub-problems, and utilizes a combination of policy models and a scoring model to generate and select the best code solutions.
These new models will drive progress in valuation and risk modeling by LLM on their own. They are also expected to increase the capabilities of multi-agent systems including live data feed and ML models.
However, in 6 months, most complex systems using agents will remain at the experimental stage, limiting the ability to automate an entire workflow. Besides, the nuanced understanding of market dynamics and design of disruptive scenarios will likely remain within the human analyst's domain.

**2 Years Outlook**
LLMs. Within 2 years however, more sweeping architectural innovations combining enlarged model sizes exceeding 5 trillion parameters (GPT5, Claude 3), novel training techniques, and high-quality curated datasets could plausibly result in LLMs exceeding average individual human cognitive capabilities across nearly all present professional benchmark tests, including finance.

Fine-tuning. Current frontier models such as GPT4 are expected to be made available for fine-tuning and open-source models which can be trained for specific purposes are expected to reach the capabilities of current frontier LLMs. This is expected to drive down the cost of using LLMs for large-scale analysis.

Over the next 6 months, steady accuracy and coherence improvements in LLMs will make them incrementally more capable at core financial analysis activities. However, they will still require close human supervision. LLMs will become moderately better at data extraction from financial reports, albeit with persistence of factual errors that analysts must catch. For risk monitoring, they can flag potential issues more reliably, but still lack the reasoning ability to weigh various risk factors. LLMs can discern financial and economic trends with higher precision given historical data, but have trouble anticipating inflection points. Valuation abilities will improve slightly, as LLMs can rapidly process more company and market data. However, they cannot match the conceptual reasoning of analysts regarding competitive dynamics and market projections. Risk modeling by LLMs has a ways to go. While churning out large volumes of models, LLMs still need analysts to frame the key considerations and determine validity.

2 Years
Language and Reasoning
In two years, LLMs will likely exhibit strong competency across a range of language understanding and reasoning tasks that underpin many financial analysis activities. Models in 2023 already display promising aptitude analyzing corpora spanning diverse topics and mediums to extract concepts, answer queries, and generate content with increasing coherence. Projecting forward based on the current pace of improvement, LLMs by 2025 may achieve granular comprehension and deduction approaching median human performance (Anthropic, 2023).

For instance, LLMs could reliably read earnings reports, financial news articles, regulatory filings and related texts to extract fine-grained data points, detect vital changes in language suggesting shifts in strategy or market dynamics, and infer deeper meaning from nuance and sentiment. This data distillation and connecting of dots was previously the exclusive domain of skilled financial analysts. Augmented by LLMs in harvesting insight from unstructured text and reasoning about implications, analysts could focus cognitive efforts on higher-order goals around framing the key questions, determining validity and relevance, and synthesizing conclusions.

Even relatively niche corners like tax optimization, complex securities structuring, and esoteric global regulations could see automation encroaching on human primacy.

Machine advantages in computational speed, information accessibility, and disciplined analytical consistency may surpass individual financial experts across most domains enabling the augmentation of most tasks. Current trajectory projections suggest LLMs could excel at certain financially-relevant capabilities like persuasive communication, deception detection, and predictive forecasting beyond levels individually attainable by even top professionals today.

Progress in AI video generation and AI connection with robotics and VR will likely enable ‘autonomous agents’ to interact with humans in virtual or real environments, closing the gap between reality and science fiction.

Multi-agent systems will incorporate very different skills, enabling the replacement of entire multi-disciplinary teams for standard workflows. But outlier gaps around the design of new workflows and systems, creative risk-taking, intuiting complex interconnections, establishing emotional bonds to do business, and applying versatile judgment seem likely to keep the most elite human practitioners securely valued.

However, they will still require close human supervision. LLMs will become moderately better at data extraction from financial reports, albeit with persistence of factual errors that analysts must catch. For risk monitoring, they can flag potential issues more reliably, but still lack the reasoning ability to weigh various risk factors. LLMs can discern financial and economic trends with higher precision given historical data, but have trouble anticipating inflection points.

Valuation abilities will improve slightly, as LLMs can rapidly process more company and market data. However, they cannot match the conceptual reasoning of analysts regarding competitive dynamics and market projections. Risk modeling by LLMs has a ways to go. While churning out large volumes of models, LLMs still need analysts to frame the key considerations and determine validity.

Regarding reporting, LLMs will be adept at summarizing data and producing first drafts. But analysts must review and refine arguments, catching subtle biases. Specialized expert models for financial data show/n Agents and multi-agent systems. Even more critically, the progress in the integration of agents and the deployment of multi-agent systems will enable the automation of complex multi-step processes and the development of 24/7 systems monitoring written and video news, processing real-time data and updating models in real-time.

But outlier cases needing advanced creative skills or versatile human judgment seem likely to remain the domain of human analysts.

5 Years Outlook

In 5 years, LLMs demonstrating cognitive capabilities comparable to median human financial specialists across sectors like accounting, investments, insurance, banking, and advising appear achievable. Even relatively niche corners like tax optimization, complex securities structuring, and esoteric global regulations could see automation encroaching on human primacy.

Machine advantages in computational speed, information accessibility, and disciplined analytical consistency may surpass individual financial experts across most domains enable the augmentation of most tasks. Current trajectory projections suggest LLMs could excel at certain financially-relevant capabilities like persuasive communication, deception detection, and predictive forecasting beyond levels individually attainable by even top professionals today.

Progress in AI video generation and AI connection with robotics and VR will likely enable ‘autonomous agents’ to interact with humans in virtual or real environments, closing the gap between reality and science fiction.

Multi-agent systems will incorporate very different skills, enabling the replacement of entire multi-disciplinary teams for standard workflows.

But outlier gaps around the design of new workflows and systems, creative risk-taking, intuiting complex interconnections, establishing emotional bonds to do business, and applying versatile judgment seem likely to keep the most elite human practitioners securely valued.

**Six Months Outlook**

With Google’s ‘Gemini Ultra’ model release, we'll see LLMs leap in capabilities, enhancing the foundational LLM/chatbot layer with sophisticated multimodal input handling: Gemini Ultra's achieved a higher score than GPT-4 in the MMMU benchmark, which assesses a range of capabilities. The main novelty of Gemini Ultra is to natively handle multiple types of data, including images, audio and live video. This will improve data extraction from reports with better capabilities to read charts and tables, aiding in more comprehensive analysis while still requiring human oversight. It will also enable summarizing live events and TV reports.

Google has also recently unveiled AlphaCode 2, powered by the Gemini AI model. AlphaCode 2 demonstrates notable advancements in coding capabilities and is particularly adept at handling complex mathematical and theoretical computer science challenges. It employs dynamic programming, a method of breaking down complex problems into simpler sub-problems, and utilizes a combination of policy models and a scoring model to generate and select the best code solutions.

These new models will drive progress in valuation and risk modeling by LLM on their own. They are also expected to increase the capabilities of multi-agent systems including live data feed and ML models.

However, in 6 months, most complex system using agents will remain at experimental stage, limiting the ability to automate an entire workflow. Besides, the nuanced understanding of market dynamics and design of disruptive scenarios will likely remain within the human analyst's domain.

**2 Years Outlook**

LLMs. Within 2 years however, more sweeping architectural innovations combining enlarged model sizes exceeding 5 trillion parameters (GPT5, Claude 3), novel training techniques, and high-quality curated datasets could plausibly result in LLMs exceeding average individual human cognitive capabilities across nearly all present professional benchmark tests, including finance.

**Fine-tuning.** Current frontier models such as GPT4 are expected to be made available for fine-tuning and open-source models which can be trained for specific purposes are expected to reach the capabilities of current frontier LLMs. This is expected to drive down the cost of using LLMs for large scale analysis.

For example, regulators could probe dynamics surrounding sudden insolvencies to assess resilience of interconnected institutions when catastrophe strikes. Or analysts could stress test untested startup bank models ahead of granting licenses. Such Applications extend the solution space by divorcing tangible risk from innovation opportunities with LLMs absorbing downsides. Disastrous failures become cheap learning opportunities rather than write-offs.

Economic upheaval similarly transitions from persistent threat into efficient accelerator. The capacity to rapidly discern cascading implications allows fluidly adapting to turmoil before detrimental impacts solidify. Models inject clarity amidst the fog of war - quickly estimating second and third order consequences to emerging crises and pointing analysts toward mitigating responses or resilient pathways to navigate uncertainty.

Together, general fluidity coupled with specialist expertise grants analysts durable competitive advantages when markets move against incumbents clinging to rigid assumptions soon outdated.

**The Next Frontier**

Beyond 5 years out, prognostications grow unreliable as accelerating change introduces unforeseeable inflection points. However, reasonable extrapolations suggest the continued melding of strengths between humans and LLMs towards common goals in financial services problem solving. With technology handling easier well-defined tasks, analysts occupy freed bandwidth tackling higher-ordered challenges requiring strategic acumen (Aggarwal et al., 2022).

The symbiotic partnership unlocks new realms presently hampered by resource constraints.

Now awakened to abundance, the next frontiers expand from merely augmenting analysts towards fundamentally transforming business models. Creative applications harness cascades of investment multipliers simply infeasible within status quo operational bounds. Entirely new markets vertically integrate previously disjointed components into coherent platforms revolutionizing how financial transactions occur.

- **Guide Through a Hypothetical Example**: It can illustrate a step-by-step calculation given hypothetical or historical cash flows, a discount rate, and a set time frame.
- **Describe Spreadsheet Implementation**: It can describe how you would set up an NPV calculation in a spreadsheet program like Excel. This might include instructions on entering cash flows, setting up the formula for discounting those cash flows to their present value, and computing the total NPV. 

**What the chatbot cannot do:**
- **Automate Spreadsheets**: While it can describe how to set up an NPV calculation in a spreadsheet, it cannot directly manipulate spreadsheet software to create the model itself.
- **Real-time Data Access**: The chatbot doesn't have the ability to access or integrate real-time financial data unless linked with external databases or provided with real-time updates.
- **Complex Assumptions and Predictions**: It cannot autonomously generate sophisticated financial forecasts or assumptions required for an NPV analysis, such as predicting future cash flows or estimating appropriate discount rates.
- **Error Checking**: It's unable to verify the accuracy or consistency of the inputs or assumptions made in an NPV calculation. This means that any output is only as reliable as the data provided to it.

For a simple, illustrative example, let's say an investment has upfront costs of $10,000, and you expect to receive $3,000 at the end of each year for the next 5 years, with a discount rate of 5%. The chatbot might help organize these inputs and guide you through applying the formula manually or in a spreadsheet, but you, as the analyst, would need to run the actual model and interpret the results.

Please let me know if there's a specific scenario or set of data you'd like to use for an NPV calculation example, or if you need further assistance with any aspect of financial modeling or analysis.
