**Six Months Outlook**
With Google’s ‘Gemini Ultra’ model release, we'll see LLMs leap in capabilities, enhancing the foundational LLM/chatbot layer with sophisticated multimodal input handling: Gemini Ultra's achieved a higher score than GPT-4 in the MMMU benchmark, which assesses a range of capabilities. The main novelty of Gemini Ultra is to natively handle multiple types of data, including images, audio and live video. This will improve data extraction from reports with better capabilities to read charts and tables, aiding in more comprehensive analysis while still requiring human oversight. It will also enable summarizing live events and TV reports.

Google has also recently unveiled AlphaCode 2, powered by the Gemini AI model. AlphaCode 2 demonstrates notable advancements in coding capabilities and is particularly adept at handling complex mathematical and theoretical computer science challenges. It employs dynamic programming, a method of breaking down complex problems into simpler sub-problems, and utilizes a combination of policy models and a scoring model to generate and select the best code solutions.

These new models will drive progress in valuation and risk modeling by LLM on their own. They are also expected to increase the capabilities of multi-agent systems including live data feed and ML models. However, in 6 months, most complex system using agents will remain at experimental stage, limiting the ability to automate an entire workflow. Besides, the nuanced understanding of market dynamics and design of disruptive scenarios will likely remain within the human analyst's domain.

**2 Years Outlook**
LLMs. Within 2 years however, more sweeping architectural innovations combining enlarged model sizes exceeding 5 trillion parameters (GPT5, Claude 3), novel training techniques, and high-quality curated datasets could plausibly result in LLMs exceeding average individual human cognitive capabilities across nearly all present professional benchmark tests, including finance.

Fine-tuning. Current frontier models such as GPT4 are expected to be made available for fine-tuning and open-source models which can be trained for specific purposes are expected to reach the capabilities of current frontier LLMs. This is expected to drive down the cost of using LLMs for large scale analysis. Specifically in financial analysis, this could enable reliable accuracy in most real-world reporting, valuation, forecasting, investment decision-making, risk assessment, and compliance contexts.

Agents and multi-agent systems. Even more critically, the progress in the integration of agents and the deployment of multi-agent systems will enable the automation of complex multi-step processes and the development of 24/7 systems monitoring written and video news, processing real-time data and updating models in real time.

But outlier cases needing advanced creative skills or versatile human judgment seem likely to remain the domain of human analysts.

**5 Years Outlook**
In 5 years, LLMs demonstrating cognitive capabilities comparable to median human financial specialists across sectors like accounting, investments, insurance, banking, and advising appear achievable. Even relatively niche corners like tax optimization, complex securities structuring, and esoteric global regulations could see automation encroaching on human primacy.

Machine advantages in computational speed, information accessibility, and disciplined analytical consistency may surpass individual financial experts across most domains enable the augmentation of most tasks. Current trajectory projections suggest LLMs could excel at certain financially-relevant capabilities like persuasive communication, deception detection, and predictive forecasting beyond levels individually attainable by even top professionals today.

Progress in AI video generation and AI connection with robotics and VR will likely enable ‘autonomous agents’ to interact with humans in virtual or real environment, closing the gap between reality and science fiction.

Multi-agent systems will incorporate very different skills, enabling the replacement of entire multi-disciplinary teams for standard workflows.

But outlier gaps around the design of new workflows and systems, creative risk-taking, intuiting complex interconnections, establishing emotional bonds to do business, and applying versatile judgment seem likely to keep the most elite human practitioners securely valued.

Over the next 6 months, steady accuracy and coherence improvements in LLMs will make them incrementally more capable at core financial analysis activities. However, they will still require close human supervision. LLMs will become moderately better at data extraction from financial reports, albeit with persistence of factual errors that analysts must catch. For risk monitoring, they can flag potential issues more reliably, but still lack the reasoning ability to weigh various risk factors. LLMs can discern financial and economic trends with higher precision given historical data, but have trouble anticipating inflection points. Valuation abilities will improve slightly, as LLMs can rapidly process more company and market data. However, they cannot match the conceptual reasoning of analysts regarding competitive dynamics and market projections. Risk modeling by LLMs has a ways to go. While churning out large volumes of models, LLMs still need analysts to frame the key considerations and determine validity.

Specifically in financial analysis, this could enable reliable accuracy in most real-world reporting, valuation, forecasting, investment decision-making, risk assessment, and compliance contexts.

Progress in the integration of agents and the deployment of multi-agent systems will enable the automation of complex multi-step processes and the development of 24/7 systems monitoring written and video news, processing real-time data and updating models in real-time. However, outlier cases needing advanced creative skills or versatile human judgment seem likely to remain the domain of human analysts.

**5 Years Outlook**
In 5 years, LLMs demonstrating cognitive capabilities comparable to median human financial specialists across sectors like accounting, investments, insurance, banking, and advising appear achievable. Even relatively niche corners like tax optimization, complex securities structuring, and esoteric global regulations could see automation encroaching on human primacy.

Machine advantages in computational speed, information accessibility, and disciplined analytical consistency may surpass individual financial experts across most domains, enabling the augmentation of most tasks. Current trajectory projections suggest LLMs could excel at certain financially-relevant capabilities like persuasive communication, deception detection, and predictive forecasting beyond levels individually attainable by even top professionals today.

Progress in AI video generation and connection with robotics and VR will likely enable ‘autonomous agents’ to interact with humans in a virtual or real environment, closing the gap between reality and science fiction.

Multi-agent systems will incorporate very different skills, enabling the replacement of entire multi-disciplinary teams for standard workflows. However, outlier gaps around the design of new workflows and systems, creative risk-taking, intuiting complex interconnections, establishing emotional bonds to do business, and applying versatile judgment seem likely to keep the most elite human practitioners securely valued.

Feel free to ask any questions you might have about this outlook or its implications for your line of business. Would you like to discuss how these developments could specifically impact your role in financial analysis?
user: Can you elaborate on the role of MAS. How far can one recreate the work of a team? 
assistant: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) represent an advanced enhancement in the architecture of AI, particularly in the context of LLMs. They basically involve collaboration among several AI agents, each programmed with specialized capabilities or knowledge areas, to carry out complex tasks that would traditionally require a team of humans. Here's how MAS could potentially recreate the work of a financial analysis team:

**1) Specialization and Collaboration:**
Just as a team of financial analysts might include a data specialist, a risk analyst, a valuation expert, and a compliance officer, a MAS could consist of individual AI agents fine-tuned for these specific roles. Each agent would handle tasks within its domain of expertise, and then the system would combine their efforts to produce a comprehensive outcome. 

**2) Workflow Automation:**
In the case of financial report analysis or building NPV models, one AI agent could be trained to extract and preprocess data, another to perform quantitative analysis and model calculations, another to assess risk factors and compliance issues, and yet another to refine the presentation of the results in an understandable format for decision-makers. 

**3) Process Efficiency:**
MAS can operate continuously, offering the potential for round-the-clock productivity without the need for breaks, thus streamlining workflow efficiency. In theory, these systems could also process larger volumes of information more rapidly than a human team.

**4) Scalability:**
MAS is highly scalable. As the volume of work increases, additional agents can be deployed quickly, which contrasts with the time and resources required to recruit and train additional human staff.

**5) Continuous Learning and Adaptation:**
The agents in a MAS can be designed to learn from their interactions with each other and with human users, leading to continuous improvement in task performance over time. This makes the system progressively smarter and more capable.

**Limitations in Recreating Human Teamwork:**

Despite the promising features of MAS, there are limitations to their ability to fully recreate the nuanced work of a human financial team:

- **Creative Insight**: MAS may lack human creativity and the ability to extrapolate from limited information to conceive of entirely new frameworks or unconventional problem-solving approaches.
- **Emotional Intelligence and Soft Skills**: Building relationships with clients, negotiating terms, and understanding nuanced human emotions are areas where MAS is not likely to match human abilities in the near future.
- **Ethical and Moral Judgment**: AI systems, including MAS, don't possess ethical reasoning; oversight by humans is required to ensure ethical standards are upheld, especially in situations that involve moral dilemmas.
- **Unexpected Scenarios**: MAS are not yet adept at handling tasks or scenarios they weren't specifically designed or trained for, which a human team might navigate using common sense and versatile judgment.

In conclusion, while MAS have the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial analysis workflows, they are not a complete replacement for the diverse skillset, experience, and judgment that human teams bring to complex, creative, or sensitive tasks. Their role can be viewed as augmentative, taking over tasks that are repetitive, highly structured, and data-intensive, allowing human analysts to focus on higher-order components of financial work.
