assistant: Excellent, your additional input helps refine the workflows. Let's incorporate the 'double materiality analysis' into Workflow 3.

### Revised Workflow 3: ESG Ratings and Compliance Provision
**Description:**
This workflow involves assigning ESG ratings to companies based on their ESG performance while also conducting a 'double materiality analysis' to ensure that reporting and disclosures are in compliance with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).

**Core Tasks:**
- Gather ESG-related data from internal and external resources for each company.

- Prepare detailed reports that justify the companies' ESG ratings, including the compliance level of their disclosures with CSRD, using charts, graphs, and written analyses.
- Monitor and update ESG ratings and compliance assessments in real-time to reflect any significant changes in the companies' data or performance.

By incorporating CSRD compliance and the double materiality analysis into the ESG ratings workflow, we can ensure a comprehensive approach that covers both the impact of sustainability issues on a company's financial performance and the implications of the company's activities on broader sustainability matters. This 360-degree view enhances both the integrity and relevacy of the ratings you provide to clients and stakeholders.

### Workflow 3: ESG Ratings Development and Compliance Analysis
